Hi, I’m a theme for <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. I’m
particularly great for a personal web page with a simple blog.

These are my best features:

* I am fully responsive
* ~~I support Disqus integration~~
* ~~I support Google Analytics~~
* I have a configurable navigation menu
* I support several code highlighting schemes
* I have Font Awesome icons
* I can live for months without <i class="fa fa-tint" aria-hidden="true"></i>
